                <h4>Understanding Child Labour</h4>
                <p><a href="https://theunitedindian.com/news/blog?child-labour-solutions-In-India=&b=199&c=2" target="_blank>">Child Labour</a> refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, potential, and dignity, interferes with their schooling, or is harmful to their physical and mental development.
